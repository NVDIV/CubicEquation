# Cubic Equation Solver

This C program solves cubic equations of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \). Developed during my programming course, the program computes the roots, which may be real or complex.

## Features

- Input coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) for the cubic equation.
- Calculate and display the roots of the equation.
- Handle cases for distinct real roots, repeated roots, and complex roots.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the ropository:
  ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/NVDIV/CubicEquation.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd CubicEquation
```
3. Compile the program:
  ```bash
  gcc -o cubic cubic.c
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
./cubic
```

## How to Use

Enter the coefficients ùëé, ùëè and ùëê when prompted.
The program will calculate and display the roots of the cubic equation..
